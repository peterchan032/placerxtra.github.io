Interactive web map using Mapbox GL
The first map is a interactive demographic map built upon Mapbox GL. Data is 2019 ACS aggregated at CBG level. This map will allow users to select several different demographic data layers (Median household income, population density, median house value, and etc.) by clicking different buttons. Hovering to each CBG can highlight the block and popup information.
